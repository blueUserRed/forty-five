                    Behind the Project
                </h3>
                <p>
                    .forty-five is being created as part of a final school project of a
                    higher technical school (<a href="https://www.htlrennweg.at/">HTL Rennweg</a>)
                    located in Vienna, Austria.
                    In the final year of the school, every student in an austrian higher
                    vocational school has to do a diploma thesis and a project alongside it.
                    Our project, .forty-five, includes implementing and creating everything necessary
                    for the game, applying the project management skills learned during the five
                    years of school, as well as ensuring a successful release on Steam.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    For the Team, .forty-five is a creative playground in which the team pours its
                    soul trying to bring the best and most fun experience to the player. Additionally,
                    no AI is involved in the process. All ideas and designs are 100% human-made,
                    as weird as they might sound :)

                <h3>
                    History
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It all started in January 2022 when Philip Jankovic, the team's creative lead,
                    had the idea to create a card game set in the Wild West after previously playing
                    "Inscription" and "Red Dead Redemption 2". After brainstorming, he came up with
                    the idea to have a revolver drum as the playing field and different kinds of
                    bullets as cards. Utilizing the revolver chambers and the rotation of the drum
                    after firing, he created the first paper prototype.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The first prototype was played in a 1v1 setting and the gameplay was quite
                    different from what it is now. Both players had revolvers and would shoot each
                    other's bullets. It was fun for a short while, but generally didn't work very well.
                    However, many cards that can be seen in the game now were already part of that
                    first experiment, such as Bewitched Bullet or Incendiary Bullet. But the gameplay
                    concept still had a long way to go.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    After a lot of trial and error and brainstorming, the game was changed to a
                    single-player game in the roguelite deckbuilder genre, which was just a better
                    fit for the revolver gameplay. So, as a small software development project
                    Philip Jankovic together with his classmate David Angelo created an early prototype.
                    The prototype still had a lot of problems gamedesign wise. However it was a step
                    in the right direction.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    On the school event days in 2022, Philip found himself in a room with Marvin Kurka,
                    a programmer, with whom he shared ideas. This resulted in them working together in
                    the fall of 2022 ot start the next project with the goal of creating a working demo.
                    This was done in the context of the subject 'ITP', where the students learn project
                    management. Together with Dylan Calderon and Christoph Allmer, a demo was created and
                    presented. In that version of the game, a complete revamp of the rules was done, including
                    the introduction of "Cover", so that the player can protect themselves from the enemy. The
                    effect system of the cards was revamped as well, allowing for cohesive and interesting
                    effects to be implemented. Additionally, the visual part of the game was developed further,
                    the color scheme was introduced and the first rendition of the art style was created. For
                    Philip Jankovic, who did not have any prior experience with drawing, .forty-five was a big
                    step into the unknown.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    In the first half of 2023, Dylan and Christoph left the team, and new people
                    joined in their place. Nils Hubman joined and is responsible for marketing as
                    well as project management. To support Philip in the visual department, Markus
                    Böheim joined, providing the needed contrast to Philip Jankovic's very messy
                    design style with clean and organized designs. The fifth person to join was
                    Felix Zwicklestorfer, a second programmer, needed to keep up with the amount
                    of workload the team set itself. The team worked on the second-semester
                    project in ITP, this time implementing the map system for the game.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    In the summer of 2023, .forty-five was proposed as a diploma project by the
                    five team members.  The project includes a deck-building system, numerous new
                    cards, various enemy types, and ultimately, the release on Steam. There is
                    still a lot of work to be done, but the team is looking forward to continuing
                    their efforts!
