### add a new card

- add an entry into the cards.onj file for the card
- add the texture for the card into the textures/cards directory
- update the card_generator_config.onj file, so it generates a texture
  for the card
- For the next start of the game, set the `generateCards` boolean in
  the `FortyFive` object to `true`.
