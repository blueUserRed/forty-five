### Explore and Collect

Explore the Frontier and add powerful cards - bullets - to your collection. Each one equipped with its own unique effect.

### Build

Each bullet has an individual effect, used to create powerful synergies. Use them to build your deck and to become an
Outlaw Legend!

### Load and shoot to kill!

Load your cards into the revolver and use the effects to your advantage, while also utilizing the
limited amount of chambers and the rotations of the revolver. Then, shoot the enemies and send
them 6 feet deep! But watch out, he won't just stand there letting you shoot him down so easily...
